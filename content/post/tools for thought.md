##### *Tools for Thought:* Intelligent Note Taking at the Speed of Articulation
   - A discussion of the various 'tools for thought' apps, used for things like note-taking, personal knowledge management (PKM), graphed bidirectional idea linking, zettelkasten, etc.
   - These deliberations are also my efforts to craft a CS & Math Engineering Note Taking System for College
   - I recognize the most popular and upcoming apps and which ones shine in certain use-cases.
   - This essay is *long* and supposed to be one of my best pieces yet.
   

The paradigm that Anytype follows is that it is open and infinitely customizable.

Obsidian is technically speaking, closed-source software.

Yet, Obsidian supports user-created plugins that use JS to actually alter app functionality. Anytype doesn't support anything of the sort. 

The storage of your knowledgebase in Obsidian is bloody simple. It's markdown files in folders on your computer. Anytype doesn't reveal the working directory of your files, and it supports more things than simple markdown.

Guess which one is actually 'open', ironic...

I am not interested in an elaborate Zettel Kasten-like PKM system. I have three simple requirements of the software of my choosing,

* I will be using it for project-management. Projects being various aspects of my life that I am working on, or work-projects. They both should play out just the same. An object-oriented system that I can grok and rely on for being productive on my endeavors.

* I am looking to create Math & CS Notes in an academic setting. 

* Finally, the environment such should be conducive to writing, creating and building connections. Basically, aesthetics and UI/UX are also quite important to me.

I am not looking for dashboards, trackers, productivity & task management software.

My learnings -

* It is possible to use an 'everything' app. Either you do everything in a sloppy fashion, or you can make everything excellent, but it quite hard and the effort is not worth it.

Sure, Obsidian has plugins that Anytype doesn't, sure it has a working directory that is visible to you, but those lacking features are on the roadmap for Anytype. Sure, it will take six months for feature-parity, and while that IS a dealbreaker in the present, let's explore deeper:

What exactly is the fundamental difference between Obsidian and Anytype?
Anytype are promoting themselves as the 'everything app'. What I feel is that, while creating something big, a network of concepts interlinked together - an investigation, a project, an undertaking. When I am starting to create something on Obsidian, the paradigm is top to bottom. 

Take a binary tree; On Obsidian, I start my way on the root node, and work my way down to the leaf notes.

In practice, Anytype feels different. You have to take care of surface-level intricacies in the beginning of your project. I have to visualize and think about how the fundamental-building blocks work, when I am starting out. Anytype feels like a bottom to top approach. Guess this is what it takes to be able to do everything.

I want to focus on the big picture.

When making a set, I have to think of the base-object. I have to look at exactly how I want my template to look like. I have to consider the relations I want my objects to have. Tags, by-far one of the most important ones, isn't an object. It is only there for filtering on a set *facepalm*.

Why are there two different ways of linking objects to each other? One is through @, and the other is /link. The UI/UX of both are also different! One occupies an entire line on its own, it's smaller in text-height, and the other is the normal way! Linking a page stops when you write a space.

When it comes to object types, I don't find it suites my purpose. I find myself constantly wanting to change around types, like page, 
note, book and the relations that they come with.

Notion's overall page structure and working is well-translated in Anytype, and the app genuinely looks beautiful, something I can also say about Notion's appearance. But when it comes to databases, Anytype is not even close! If I try to use Sets and Collections with the purpose of Notion databases, I vomit a little in my mouth.

You can use Obsidian or Notion. Both are entirely different style of apps. Anytype could have eliminated the need for both. Instead, it only copies the UI of Notion, and produces a sub-par version of Obsidian file-linking.

I started out my note-taking journey on Obsidian. Along the lines, I realized that networked knowledge isn't that important to me (I was in high school, and you really don't need that sort of thing), and I switched to Notion for project-management and writing.

It was great for a while, until I imbibed everything about the app. I wanted more features, and I wanted more performance. I fought with the app, but going through update release-cycle after update, I realized that they weren't going to change. 

Notion wanted to establish themselves as the best *online* productivity software. They did everything to make that a reality. At this point, I gained more respect for their mission, use their service for however-much it's worth. 

I am not going to even try to use Notion for academic notetaking. Maybe it's because I'm not an English major that I can't consider this as a possibility, so it is what it is. Notion is fine for tasks, but it absolutely doesn't come close to dedicated task & calendar apps in terms of erasing friction from user workflow.

And nothing beats Obsidian for what it is.

I'm going back to Notion for project-management, Obsidian for notes & research, and a separate app for tasks & calendar and productivity.


Here is a list of all the apps.

I just *love* the Comedy that makes you cry, on the floor laughing and in stitches. It's re-playable, cheers you up and you can have a good time.

As a self-proclaimed Man of Culture, a Dank Memer, and a Meme Lord in the land of the Internet-tia, I do enjoy memes, but they rarely make me laugh out loud. At most, I might manage a chuckle or an exhale of the nostril, and only occasionally a big laugh. The problem with memes is that they get old quickly, and one needs increasingly intense versions to keep the laughs coming. This creates a sort of tolerance to image/gif-based short-form content, making it less effective at generating laughs over time. In contrast, classic comedy still trumps memes in making anyone laugh.

But not all comedians are equal. People of your home country seem way funnier than others. For me, Indians will always be the funniest. After all, the joy of jokes and insults just hits different in the native tongue. Also I don’t just mean Indian comedians, I could walk into any group of people and find an absolutely hilarious dude or gal

Besides Indians, I dig my African and South American brother and sisters. Comedians of these demographics are the ones who can make you laugh so hard that your stomach hurts. They are the bomb when it comes to jokes and insults. They don’t hold back on making fun of anything and anyone. They use their body language, facial expressions, and accents like weapons of mass comedy.

So that's my taste in comedy. We are born and destined for greatness. We try and make meaning of our lives before it all ends, but most of life isn’t spent in a climax, it’s spent living.

Comedy and laughter is what we _live_ for. I believe that one’s taste in comedy isn’t a reflection of their class or culture, it isn’t a reflection of anything. It’s just what they prefer to look at to cheer up and have a good time.

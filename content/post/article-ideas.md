## Article Ideas
I have come up with several complex thoughts that I plan to write about in the future. Whenever I glance at any of these ideas, I can already envision sub-textually exploring them in a 2-3 thousand word essay each. Each topic struck me at some point as an important thing to talk about, and is rich in content, with so much depth and nuance that can be explored.

I'm excited to develop interesting ideas further, learn about them myself, and share them here. I'm adding good links to read about them yourself incase you can't wait for me :)

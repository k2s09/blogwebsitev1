I have come up with several interesting ideas and complex thoughts to pursue and write about in the future. Whenever I take a glance at any of these ideas, I can already envision sub-textually exploring them in essays anywhere from one to three thousand words each.

Each topic struck me at some point as an important thing to talk about, and is rich in content, along with so much depth and nuance that can be explored.

I am excited to develop interesting ideas further, learn about them myself and share them here. Incase you don't want to wait for me, I've added a few links where you can learn more about them on your own :)

## I'm working on it
1. *Tools for Thought:* Intelligent Note Taking at the Speed of Articulation
   - A discussion of the various 'tools for thought' apps, used for things like note-taking, personal knowledge management (PKM), graphed bidirectional idea linking, zetteltasken, etc.
   - These deliberations are also my efforts to craft a CS & Math Engineering Note Taking System for College
   - I recognize the most popular and upcoming apps and which ones shine in certain use-cases.
   - This essay is *long* and supposed to be one of my best pieces yet.

2. *The Axiomatic Argument:* A Logical Tool for Evaluating Beliefs & Finding Meaning in Life
   - Another one of my dabbles in the fields of Rationality, Humanism, Cognitive Psychology, Philosophy
   - The article starts off with great pragmatic interest: Introducing axiomatic arguments and using them to assess and develop our worldviews.
   - It then proceeds to discuss some of the philosophical challenges and opportunities that arise from moving away from religion as a source of meaning and morality, and how we can use reason to develop alternative frameworks that can inspire us to live well and flourish.

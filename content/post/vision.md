Being articulate and fluent doesn't imply that I'm confident knowing enough about anything. I have no inclination to teach anything. My intention is not to educate others. I am writing to learn and store my own ideas. Writing and expressing ideas is not a zero-sum game, therefore I decide to publish these articles.

My method: _Using a rigorous and reflective process to gain a deep understanding of topics and form strong principles based on this understanding._

My process of writing involves deep thinking and exploration of topics to gain a multidimensional understanding of a concept or idea, and then try to come up with conclusions. I practise model-based thinking to test and form conclusions that are based on a strong understanding of a logical system.

Strong conclusions that align with my principles form the basis for my decision-making, actions, and way of life. I update my beliefs from time-to-time to ensure they remain relevant and aligned with my evolving understanding of reality.

I do this a lot. I hardly publish everything that I write.

## Introduction

Typing feels like a mundane activity to most. Nowadays, classes for learning typing etiquette is uncommon. Most people don’t think twice about the effect typing really has on their life and thus put little effort in their keyboards and typing skill.

Now more than ever, a lot of what we do in our lives indirectly depends on typing. It is the fundamental way we chose to interact with computers. This is a link of communication between us and the machines, and if we are efficient in the way we type, we can fluently and effortlessly communicate our thoughts and opinions over to the digital world.

Before you say it, I don't think swiping your finger on an iPad beats using ten fingers on a full keyboard, but hey, until brain chips come along, the keyboard is our best choice.

The brain is a bad medium of storage for long term thought. Who knows how much we have lost from the past because it was lost in translation through the ages!

The main argument is: The more well versed you are at a language, the better you can interact with locals of that language. If you went on a trip to a foreign country, you’ll have a better time if you can easily interact with the locals. For a lot of us, the level of interaction we have with a computer is bottlenecked by our typing speed, and we could exchange ideas and converse with a computer with much more ease, if typing was natural to us, if the keybaord was an extension of our fingers.

For a lot of us, learning proper typing can be a huge benefit to their lives. I made this realisation during the start of 2020. I found that my typing and reading speed directly impacted my academics and digital hobbies. So I got to work on it, and this is my journey.

## My journey

I was always interested in computers. I was always very curious and into gadgets, always wanting to understand them from the inside. Admittedly, this ruined my track record with devices. But, it made me dig deeper into things. I guess I was just bored and tech seemed fun.

I was always somewhat fast in typing. I always typed faster than my peers throughout the years. As of today, I type at 130 WPM consistently with shorter bursts upto 150-160 ish, and extremely short bursts upto 190-200 WPM. I'm not joking.

## Getting Faster

The most essential element to fast typing is muscle memory. Earlier I was harping on the human brain, but our minds are spectacular. Once we establish pathways and repeatedly train them, boy, we can get good.

Everybody already has some form of muscle memory associated with typing. You may not be using the most efficient 'system' for typing, but with a strong muscle memory, you can still get significantly faster by doing the same thing you are doing now, but faster.

Ideally, you have to go around optimising your muscle memory for each aspect of perfect typing. Here is how I would categorise it:

1. The Layout - Get familiar with the keyboard layout you use (QWERTY, most probably). Learn to type all alphabets at once without looking at the keyboard and make mental data structures for words when typing them, almost like making the shape you get by glide typing something on your phone.
3. Finger Distribution - Then comes the part of assigning the appropriate fingers to the keys. A rather lengthy process it is. The idea is simple, just push through the work - Allow yourself to only press a given key using a given finger. The more fingers you use for typing, the faster the easier on the fingers it will be. Work your way up from 3-4 fingers upto 8-10 fingers.
4. Speed and Accuracy - The most important thing to remember is that accuracy triumphs everything. Speed will come naturally with time and practise but a perfect form will help you be the most efficient.

Most of us are doing this the wrong way. You might go wrong too, but if I had to teach myself, from scratch, the right way, that's how I would do it.

## An Analysis on Keyboard Layouts

Another very interesting change you can adopt to increase your typing speed is your keyboard layout. Try DVORAK or COLEMAK. The layout we use nowadays is the QWERTY layout. It was created in the late 19th century by Christopher Sholes. Simply put, it is shite.

> A century after Sholes finalised the keyboard, historian Jan Noyes of Loughborough University published a lengthy analysis concluding: “There appears … to be no obvious reason for the placement of letters in the QWERTY layout.”

The layout was not designed with touch-typists in mind. As Noyes pointed out: ‘the original QWERTY keyboard was intended for “hunt and peck” operation and not touch-typing’. That may explain the well-known practical shortcomings of QWERTY. In the 1930s, as typewriters and typing became more common, researchers began questioning its usefulness. One fierce critic, educational psychologist August Dvorak (a distant cousin of the composer), had a team of engineers test 250 keyboard variations and concluded that the QWERTY design was one of the worst possible arrangements.

The real reason for its stubborn persistence is inertia: imagine the cost of designing, testing and manufacturing an alternative – and then retraining billions of people to use it. As long as keying letters into a machine is needed, QWERTY is here to stay.

With that said, learning a layout like Colemak is a one-time investment that will allow you to enjoy faster and pain-free typing for the rest of your life. I would recommend it **over** DVORAK due to the fact that common shortcut keys remain in the same place like those for Copy and Paste. It would really suck to re-wire your brain for such elemental operations. Also, most of the typing is done on the strongest and fastest fingers. Low same-finger ratio.

### Benefits of Colemak

→ *Ergonomic and Comfortable* - Your fingers on QWERTY move 2.2x more than on Colemak. QWERTY has 16x more same hand row jumping than Colemak. There are 35x more words you can type using only the home row on Colemak. Lesser locomotion means your fingers would be less fatigued.  

→ *Fast* - Most of the typing is done on the strongest and fastest fingers. Low same-finger ratio.  

→ *Free* - Free software released under the public domain. You don't have to buy a new keyboard, just install a program.  

→ *Easy to Learn* - Allows easy transition from QWERTY. Only 2 keys move between hands.  

→ *Basic shortcuts remain same* - Many common shortcuts (including Ctrl+Z/X/C/V) remain the same.  

A very interesting, un-noticed aspect of switching to a new keyboard layout or learning the same layout again with perfect form is that there is a middle period of about two to three weeks while learning when you are in the process of forgetting your previous muscle memory and building new neural links in your mind while learning the new layout, when your speed drops to the lowest. You typing is abysmal and dysfunctional. If out of necessity, you switch to your old habits, then you start to lose the benefits of the new process and would have to start over. There are several ways to combat this - learn typing at a time when you do not have much pressure and your work doesn’t demand, only use your phone for any typing tasks, use voice dictation or just have *very* understanding peers.

Understand the significance of typing and keyboards. Try to type correctly, and you will get way faster. Realise as many changes in your life as you want. I use all these techniques to improve my typing and be in the *fast club.* [Join me?](https://monkeytype.com)
